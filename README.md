# Sentiment flow track

A repo of the code for a consulting project in the Summer 2019 Insight Data Science Fellowship (Remote Session). This code has two main functions:

1. Extracting sentiment scores on an utterance level using the VADER sentiment analysis tool and generating plots of change in sentiment over time (https://github.com/chilverman/sentiment_flow_track/blob/master/insight_vader_sentiment_flow.ipynb)

2. Training several supervised learning models to classify emotion from transcripts (https://github.com/chilverman/sentiment_flow_track/blob/master/insight_emotion.ipynb)

Because this is a consulting project, the data have been intentionally left out of this repo for security/privacy purposes.
